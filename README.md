# Dual Grid

Welcome to the repository of my Dual Grid implementation for Unity.

## Features

Here's what this library can do:

- ‚ú® __Fully working Dual Grid System__: Paint a Data Tilemap and it all gets visually updated in a Render Tilemap.
- üîÑ __Automatic Setup__: It takes seconds to setup a dual grid system;
- ü§ù __Full Unity Integration__: Full integration with Unity's Tilemap and Rule Tiles;
- üß© __Rule Tile Creation__: Streamlined rule tile creation with full rule definition;

## The Dual Grid Tilemap

The Dual Grid Tilemap is a method to render tiles using two grids, instead of one. One grid is to indicate what each tile is and the render tilemap renders tiles with a half-tile offset in both axis. 

Many people use different terms for each grid, but in this library you'll find the __Data Tilemap__ and the __Render Tilemap__.

I won't go into detail here, because this concept is already very well explained:

## Getting started

To start using this library, check the [getting started](Documentation/getting-started.md) page. It has a guide on how to __install__ and __setup__ the library.

## Dependencies

This library depends on [Unity.2D.Tilemap.Extras](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.2d.tilemap.extras@4.1/manual/index.html). It was tested using version 4.0.2, which comes pre-built when a new 2D Universal Render Pipeline Project is created.

## Author's note

I knew about the Dual Grid system before, but seeing [Jess Hammer's implementation](https://github.com/jess-hammer/dual-grid-tilemap-system-unity) inspired me to use my programming abilities to make my own implementation, as I couldn't find more anywhere. 

Everything is open source and I'll be releasing it in the Unity Asset Store __for free__ so anyone can readily use it without having to get it from Git. I'm making this available now because Unity Asset Store submissions are excruciatingly long.

Thanks for reading.
